                            Five stories about the mundane lives, where if one might find small implosions in human emotions, feelings, in suffering, joy, and love.

                        The book is a gray area drafting banalities between the real psychological approach to understanding living and the anxiety of dying and accepting it and the spiritual way of this acceptance. There are lots of points one can make that doesn't actually lead a person to a truly aware, and true acceptance of the "END" that lies in front of him, rather persuades in making a connection to the continuation through universal consciousness.

                        Old Holden was in pain and he told me he felt lonely as hell. He was there with me but always a bit far away maybe a few steps away but he was there. I never met him again, maybe he ran away ,maybe he graduated, I don't know, it was a long time ago maybe he's not there anymore, and now I miss him even more.

                        Strife between the roots of home, culture, identity, and the westernized tomb of success. A story unfolding the series of events that took place in Changez's life as a Pakistani first-generation migrant as he pushed to the epitome of success in the states to an unknown listener.<br />As the reader takes the position of this unknown listener and succumbs into a direct first-person conversation it makes a unique experience from the dusty tea-stalls of Lahore to the sunny-afternoons of Manhattan.

                        Before he became 'Che' he was a free spirit, and this book is a narration of not only an explorer or a student doctor but a free spirit who saw America in its truest colors. Reading this book is not only a visual journey along with Earnesto and Alberto and their good old Le Poderosa but a contemplation of a vast continent divided by borders, consumed by corporations exploited by administration yet the presence of an ether of unity amongst the spirit of people and their struggle. This book is the very reminder of his words-<br /><br />“Let the world change you and you can change the world”<br /><br />― Ernesto Che Guevara

                        Murakami's signature style is draped all over each page of the book. He has this capability to explore complex human emotions with utmost simplicity along with making changes in contrast to the surroundings of the characters. This in depth exploration is quite a charm of Murakami in his contribution to literature. Norwegian Wood revolves around a teenage boy name Toru Watanabe as he stumbles through life in 70s Tokyo, both his life and the city (Where he is a university student) goes through vivid changes. Love, loss, and death all are intermingled with life and the book takes you to a trip to this revelation through the eyes of the 19 year old.
